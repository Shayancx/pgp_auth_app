# Security Improvements Applied

This document outlines the security improvements that have been applied to the PGP Auth application.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Security Issues

### 1. CSRF Protection Enabled
- **Issue**: CSRF protection was disabled
- **Fix**: Re-enabled Rack::Csrf middleware and implemented proper CSRF token generation
- **Impact**: Prevents cross-site request forgery attacks

### 2. Zero-Knowledge Architecture
- **Issue**: Verification codes and challenge codes stored in plaintext
- **Fix**: All codes are now SHA-256 hashed before storage
- **Impact**: True zero-knowledge - server never sees plaintext secrets

### 3. Session Security Enhanced
- **Issue**: Session tokens stored in plaintext
- **Fix**: Session tokens are now SHA-256 hashed before storage
- **Impact**: Database compromise doesn't expose valid session tokens

### 4. Username Enumeration Prevention
- **Issue**: Different error messages revealed if username exists
- **Fix**: Generic error messages with timing attack protection
- **Impact**: Attackers cannot determine valid usernames

### 5. IP Spoofing Protection
- **Issue**: Trusted X-Forwarded-For header blindly
- **Fix**: Configurable trusted proxy with proper validation
- **Impact**: Rate limiting cannot be bypassed via header spoofing

### 6. Password Security Enhanced
- **Issue**: 8-character minimum was too weak
- **Fix**: 12+ characters with complexity requirements
- **Impact**: Much stronger password security

### 7. Security Headers
- **Fix**: Added X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.
- **Impact**: Protection against clickjacking, XSS, and other attacks

### 8. Audit Logging
- **Fix**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Impact**: Full audit trail for security monitoring

## üîí Security Best Practices Now Implemented

1. **Zero-Knowledge**: No plaintext secrets stored
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
3. **Secure by Default**: Production-ready security configuration
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete security event logging
5. **Progressive Security**: Escalates to PGP-only on suspicious activity

## üöÄ Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Generate secure session secret
export SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64)

# For production, set trusted proxy IP
export TRUSTED_PROXY_IP="10.0.0.1/32"  # Your load balancer IP
```

### Database Migrations

The security migration adds:
- `code_hash` column to challenges (for zero-knowledge)
- `failed_login_count` and `last_failed_login_at` to accounts
- Security indices for performance
- `success` flag to audit logs

## üìä Security Monitoring

Monitor these security events in audit logs:
- `login_failed` - Failed login attempts
- `password_failed` - Failed password attempts
- `pgp_auth_failed` - Failed PGP authentication
- `session_ip_changed` - Session IP address changes
- `session_revoked` - Manual or automatic session revocation
- `all_sessions_revoked` - Bulk session revocation

## üõ°Ô∏è Rate Limiting

Rate limits are enforced for:
- Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
- Password attempts: 10 per hour
- Registration: 3 per hour
- PGP verification: 3 per 30 minutes
- 2FA attempts: 5 per 5 minutes

## üîê PGP Security

- Keys are validated on import
- Expired keys are rejected
- Trust model uses signature verification
- Challenges use 32-character random codes

## üö® Incident Response

If a security issue is discovered:

1. Immediately revoke all sessions if authentication is compromised
2. Force password resets if needed (while maintaining zero-knowledge)
3. Review audit logs for suspicious activity
4. Update and patch immediately

## üìù Regular Maintenance

Set up cron jobs for cleanup:

```bash
# Cleanup expired sessions hourly
0 * * * * /path/to/app/cleanup_sessions.rb

# Cleanup old rate limits daily
0 2 * * * /path/to/app/cleanup_rate_limits.rb
```
