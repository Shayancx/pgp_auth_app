# Security Improvements Applied

This document outlines the security improvements that have been applied to the PGP Auth application.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Security Issues

### 1. CSRF Protection Enabled
- **Issue**: CSRF protection was disabled
- **Fix**: Re-enabled Rack::Csrf middleware and implemented proper CSRF token generation
- **Impact**: Prevents cross-site request forgery attacks

### 2. Session Secret Security
- **Issue**: Hard-coded fallback session secret
- **Fix**: SESSION_SECRET environment variable is now required
- **Impact**: Prevents session hijacking in production deployments

### 3. Session Token Security
- **Issue**: Session tokens stored in plaintext in database
- **Fix**: Session tokens are now hashed (SHA-256) before storage
- **Impact**: Database compromise doesn't immediately expose valid session tokens

### 4. Removed Redundant Dependencies
- **Issue**: Rodauth included but not actually used
- **Fix**: Removed Rodauth gem and replaced session key references
- **Impact**: Reduced attack surface and cleaner codebase

### 5. Code Cleanup
- **Issue**: Unused route modules and features
- **Fix**: Removed unused files and duplicate code
- **Impact**: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## üîí Security Best Practices Now Implemented

1. **Environment Variables**: All secrets must be provided via environment variables
2. **Token Hashing**: Session tokens are cryptographically hashed
3. **CSRF Protection**: All forms protected against cross-site request forgery
4. **Rate Limiting**: Comprehensive rate limiting on all authentication endpoints
5. **Session Management**: Secure session creation, validation, and cleanup
6. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of security events

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Set SESSION_SECRET environment variable before starting the application
2. Consider implementing additional security headers (HSTS, CSP improvements)
3. Regular security audits and dependency updates
4. Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity

## üìù Environment Setup

Before running the application, ensure you have set the required environment variable:

```bash
export SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 64)
```

Or add it to your `.env` file:

```
SESSION_SECRET=your_64_character_random_string_here
```
